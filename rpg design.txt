Rpg simulation

Side scrolling terrain with small 8 bit characters

Game date will advance in real time when you are out questing

Terrain can be made of small repeatable mixable patches of graphics

Could have parallax or a background and foreground layer

Could have outdoor and indoor environments

Quests are randomly generated and given to you by the king / whoever you are working for

Quests will pass through different areas of the world and have different objectives with different monsters encountered and different rewards

There could be multiple quests to choose from.

If a quest is not competed by the due date it is no longer available

Time limit on quests

Stopping to camp allows you to craft but wastes time

Crafting system will use items dropped by monsters to create weapons etc

Items can have huge stats epic etc

Need to figure out how player will learn new crafting recipes

Monsters drop items to use for crafting

World is generated randomly at the start of the game.   Zones names bosses etc

Characters can die in combat and need to be replaced

Different character classes

Party of four

More than four classes

Each class had different skills to level up

Player has to choose how to mix and match to make the best party

Player has to interact with battles just by pressing buttons

Some choices to make might be what formation to use, what skills to use for every character etc

Future version could have graphical map of world that player can look at while they are on a quest

Future version could have dialogue interacting with different  choices

Future versions could have an overarching story sweep that develops through the random quests.

Or multiple story sweeps that just keep going as long as the player keeps playing

The difficulty of the game should build as long as possible with procedurally generated crafting recipes, monsters, bosses etc

Future version the quests that are not completed might also affect story

Need ideas for how player interacts with game especially in battles

Some kind of mini games to perform skills? Or just press buttons to make choices? Mini game during adventures could be very cool

Different races

Characters age

Characters in party of same class will level up other characters faster (teaching them tricks)

Characters will die of old age or be unable to continue

Future version tells a story over hundreds of years with many Heros and the player can look at a book of history that writes about what the characters have accomplished (major story events)

The future version game is about building the history of a nation through the actions of a few brave adventurers

Future version maybe technology will advance or new techniques will be learned

Mentalist type

Side effect of skills if not performed correctly

Press buttons to perform skills in combat / actions

Game world is broken up into rings of the eight directions with columns and rows of locations. The locations get much more difficult as you go to the outer rows. The difficulty of areas within a row will also vary.

Quest difficulty will be represented by the % chance that you will get killed
