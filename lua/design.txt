Story board

The time and date is January 2nd, current year, 7:55 A.M.(the game always starts in the current year)

Game starts with the 2d version of the player outside the bank. 

The story overlay pops up to tell them that they have always dreamed of starting a hotel, that today is an exciting day, and that they have an appointment at 8:00 A.M. with a bank to secure a loan that will allow them to start their business!

The player can enter the bank or can start to wander around the city if they want.

When the player enters the bank they have the option to leave the bank or talk with the secretary.

If the player is male then the secretary is female and vice versa.

When the player talks with the secretary if it is before 8:00 A.M. the secretary basically tells them that the banker isn't ready yet.

The player can try and hit on the secrtary. 

How the player talks with the secratry affects certain stats and how the conversation goes with the banker.

After 8:00 A.M. but before 8:15 A.M. there is some random chance that the banker will be ready for the player every time they talk with the secretary.

After 8:15 A.M. but before 8:30 A.M. the banker is always ready for the player and the player starts the conversation with the banker.

After 8:30 A.M. the secretary notifies the player that their appointment has been cancelled because they were too late. The player can not get money from the bank and must try and start a hotel some other way.

There is always the option to sell drugs or to play the stock market.

Drugs and stock market are the same principal except one is legal and the other illegal.

If the player sells drugs they can get arrested.

If the player starts the conversation with the banker then the player will be given a loan with a value and terms that vary depending on how they answered the questions.

The results of the banker conversation will also affect starting skills and stats.
